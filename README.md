# aa-google-form-filler

* Script that fills out that stupid form

## Setup you need to do
* You need to download the selenium chrome webdriver
* Put your name and last name in `first_name` and `last_name`
* You need to copy and paste the link to the form and put it in `google_form_link` and you also need to change the `week_of` variable to the week that the form is for
* You need to add a `config.rb` file and create 2 variables:
```
ENV['email'] = your_gmail
ENV['password'] = your_password
```
or I suppose you can just hardcode it in the script

Screw the micro-managing
